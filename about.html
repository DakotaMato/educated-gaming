    <h2>About Me and This Website</h2>
    <p> Educated Gaming was made because, as a child, I often found myself playing video games more than watching movies
    or reading books. As a result, the stories and lessons I learned from games have been invaluable. In spite of this,
    many people do not believe video games can tell worthwhile stories or provide useful knowledge. This website is here
    to prove them wrong.</p>

    <h3>Want to See A Game Discussed?</h3>
    <p> There are so many games out there that I have yet to experience but deserve to be mentioned. If you think you
    know a game in particular that taught you something new or sparked your hunger for learning, complete the form below
    ,and it might get added!</p>
