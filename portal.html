    <h2>Portal</h2>
    <p>Portal is a first-person puzzle game created by Valve that asks the player to think with, well, portals. Although
    portals don't exist in real life, the nature of the puzzles demands logical thinking regarding non-euclidean space
    and a manipulation of physics in order to succeed in the game. Although it might be easy for some people, basic logical
    reasoning can be a struggle for many people, especially younger children. In this aspect, portal is a fun-filled way
    to help stimulate one's brain with fun puzzles.</p>

    <p>To give an example of a way in which Portal helps teach basic logic, one of the opening obstacles involves simple vertical
    traversal. The player is shown the portal gun (the device the player uses to create portals) shooting a portal in order
    to get them to this example puzzle, so the player knows how the gun works, but has yet to test it out. However, the game
    helps you since this is the first puzzle with the gun, as one of your two portals has already been placed for you on a ledge
    you cannot reach by simply jumping. All the player has to do to make it to the above area is place a portal in a location
    they can reach (which is most of the ground, even that beneath the player's feet) and walk through. This helps communicate
    to the player how the portals work and how to think outside the box.</p>
