    <h2>Animal Crossing</h2>
    <p>Animal Crossing is a game where you play as a mayor managing your own community: its finances, villagers, and
    appearance are all aspects that you decide on. Although most people play the Animal Crossing games for their cute
    characters and relaxing atmosphere, there's actually quite a lot to learn for players both young and old about personal
    finances. As with real life, managing a town isn't something that can be done without funds and planning, and that's
    just what Animal Crossing helps its players learn!</p>

    <p>Within the games, most purchases and transactions are made using bells, the form of currency that replaces money
    in the Animal Crossing universe. Right off the bat with most games, the player needs a home that they can call their own
    while they manage their town. However, homes aren't free, and the player will have to take out a mortgage that will be
    paid off over the course of the game in order to get their home. With both their own debt and the goal of making a really
    great the village, the player is given an incentive to acquire more bells. But how do they do this? Much like in real
    life, there are many ways you can make money.</p>

    <p>First on the list is the 'stalk market', where the player can purchase Turnips for a certain, random price each Sunday
    during the week. The value of the turnips will vary each day, going higher some days and lower on others, just like
    with stocks in our world. The player only has one week to sell turnips each time they are bought, so the player has to
    really consider their options and if the risk for a high payoff is worth the potential for a loss of funds. The second
    method of obtaining currency is through interest, which the player can accrue through investing in a savings account.
    Although the moment-to-moment payoff is much lower than that of turnip trading, the tradeoff is that you are guaranteed
    to always get more funds as long as you have bells in your account. The more bells you put in to your account, the more
    you'll get out of it, which, following the pattern, is like real life savings accounts. These are just two of the ways
    in which the game helps teach the player about real world finances, but there are plenty more to be found (all with
        the comfort of knowing you won't go broke in real life!)which is part of what makes the game such a great tool.
    It encourages experimentation and finding what works for you.</p>
