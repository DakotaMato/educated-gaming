    <h2>Kerbal Space Program</h2>
    <p>Kerbal Space Program is a space-flight simulation game that uses a realistic physics engine to fuel its basic gameplay
    mechanics. The game is notable in that it is officially endorsed by NASA and the European Space Agency, so if that doesn't
    count for anything right off the bat, I'm not sure what will. Regardless, the basic goal of the game is to successfully
    launch rockets into outer space and go on further space missions to other planets and solar systems.</p>

    <p>Despite being the games' primary focus, you don't need to be a rocket scientist in order to succeed, although having
    an understanding of basic physics and engineering principles will help players on their journey throughout the game.
    The game teaches players about fundamental physics mechanics that are important considerations in aerospace missions
    such as fuel-to-weight ratios, orbital modelling, and gravity through the in-game interface telling you in real-time
        how said mechanics are affecting your space-craft. Unlike real life, though, the player isn't losing millions
    of dollars when things go wrong, which invites them to experiment and really think about what might have gone wrong
    with their rocket design and reconsider if they truly understand all the underlying physics mechanics in play. The wacky
    visuals also make for an inviting atmosphere that can help ease frustration if you go multiple attempts without a success.</p>
