    <h2>Spore</h2>
    <p>Spore is a real-time simulation game where the player creates their own organism and helps them evolve through various means
    by accumulating 'dna points'. Although the game is wildly inaccurate when it comes to its depiction of evolution and how creatures
    are developed over time, accuracy isn't the main draw and is not the lens the game should be judged by when it comes to its value as a
    learning tool. The game should, rather, be judged by how it gathers intrigue from the player into the development of organisms
    and life science. Through environmental hardships and different adaptions, the player's creatures will evolve and this basic
    principle of needing to evolve in order to succeed and thrive is a good starting point for a player to start asking
    questions about evolution in our world.</p>

    <p>For the uninitiated, evolution is basically how living beings adapt over time to their environment. The traits of organisms
    that are able to reproduce are carried over to the next generation of offspring, and although in game the player is in control of
    this, if one views the player as the judge of what traits are deemed 'desirable', there is a parallel to be made between
    the process of evolution in real life versus that which is displayed in the game.</p>

    <p>The player can really go wild with their creations, making big, small, beautiful, or ugly organisms that start life
    as tiny, near single-cell organisms that eventually become multi-cell organisms with multiple organells and new traits. This
    appeal to creativity and fun gameplay loop where the player can live through their organism.</p>
