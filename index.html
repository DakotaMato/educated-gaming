            <h3>Video Games Can Teach</h3>

            <p>
                For too long have video games been thought of as time wasters and sources of brain rot. Interactive media
                has a place alongside cinema and literature to tell elaborate stories with complex themes and teach their
                audience valuable lessons about the real world. From older games to modern hits, games have been a well
                of knowledge for a long time, despite the stigma around them as being lesser in comparison to other art
                forms. That is what this website seeks to resolve. By clicking on our 'All Subjects' page, you will be
                shown different branches of knowledge in which games have been used to teach with articles discussing various
                examples. I hope you enjoy your time on this website! As a disclaimer, I am not an expert on every subject,
                so I will likely make some mistakes along the way, but will do my best to be as accurate as possible.
