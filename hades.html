    <h2>Hades</h2>
    <p>Taking a step back from real world historical events, in this entry we're going to talk about a rather famous
    pantheon that was a strong influence on a well known civilization: The Greek Pantheon. However, rather than focusing
    on Zeus, Poseidon, or Athena, the titular character of this hack'n'slash rogue-like title is Hades, God of the Underworld.
    Despite being in the title, Hades is not the protagonist, although he does play a major part in the story. The protagonist of the story
    is a lesser known being called Zagreus, Hades' son. Over the course of the game, the player learns more about the ins
    and outs of the relationships between the various gods.</p>

    <p>While not being very well known to your average person, Zagreus is actually a real figure in Greek mythology, theorized
    to have been mixed up with Dionysus (the god of wine) by some Greeks back in the day Some theorized he was even Hades
    himself, an alter ego of sorts. Regardless, it's the attention to little details like that that makes
    this game such a wonderful vessel for launching people into the world of Greek mythology. Although the game goes with
    the interpretation of Zagrues being Hades' son, there's a little joke in the story that alludes to the historical mixup
    between Dionysus and Zagreus, Dionysus telling Zagreus to make up a story about how the two of them used to be one person.</p>

    <p>Moving on, not only is the game packed with little details like I mentioned before, but the story and characters
    are wonderfully written, giving all that choose to invest themselves into the story a real treat. Drama, tragedy, and
    many laughs are to be had in this title that reflect the actual stories of the Greek gods. Because of its well crafted
    narrative, people who are hooked on the story are likely to start looking more into Greek mythology than they would have
    before.</p>
